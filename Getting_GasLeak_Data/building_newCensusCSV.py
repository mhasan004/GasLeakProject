# PART 3: now making new csv that is based on time
# 1) df = get the csv data.
# 2) dateDF = loop throught the "Date" column and and make a new data frame for entries that has same Date
# 3) hourlyDF = for each dateDF, loop through the "Hour" column and make a new data frame for entries that has same Hour 
# 4) tractDF  = for each hourlyDF, loop through the "Census Tract" column and make a new data frame for entries that has same Hour
