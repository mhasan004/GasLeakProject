# GasLeakProject
An interactive web application that will visualize the locations of all reported gas leaks in New York using Python Dash. Will predict areas that are less likely to report gas leaks and will analyze the socioeconomic conditions in those areas. 


**GettingDataFrom_ConEd/conEd_SceduledWebscraperJsonCSV.py:**
This Python script periodically scrapes gas leak report from the ConEdison website and appends the data of new gas leak reports to the UNION.csv and ticketList.txt files and pushes the changes to GitHub so that I can have the latest history.
