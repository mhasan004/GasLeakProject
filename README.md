# GasLeakProject
An interactive web application that will visualize the locations of all reported gas leaks in New York using Python Dash. Will predict areas that are less likely to report gas leaks and will analyze the socioeconomic conditions in those areas. 


**GettingDataFrom_ConEd/conEd_SceduledWebscraperJsonCSV.py:**
Wrote a python script that periodically scrapes relevant gas leak data from Con Edison and appends data of new gas reports to a CSV and TXT file and pushes the changes to GitHub so that i can have the latest changes no matter where i am working from.
