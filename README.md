# GasLeakProject
An interactive web application that will visualize the locations of all reported gas leaks in New York using Python Dash. Will predict areas that are less likely to report gas leaks and will analyze the socioeconomic conditions in those areas. Wrote a python script that periodically scrapes relevant gas leak data from ConEdison.
